# MDT
This is just an idea at the moment

# THE IDEA
- An in-game MDT tied into OpenCad
# IN GAME
- hot key opens GUI
- hot key only works when in car
- officer types in a name or license plate and gets a return
- uses existing OpenCad data
# REQUIREMENTS
- OpenCad
- MYSql-Async
- database will likely be shared with any RP framework

# IS THIS USELESS
Sure it is.  It's just as easy to Shift+Tab to use your OpenCad.  However, this is just for RP purposes.

# HOW NARP USES THIS
- Pat pushes civ character and vehicle data to existing ESX database
- script reads those tables
